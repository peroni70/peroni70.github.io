Hello! I'm a grad student at MIT in the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu/) (ORC) where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor [Dimitris Bertsimas](https://dbertsim.mit.edu/). I'm currently focused on building interpretable, incentive-aware and robust machine learning systems for high-stakes decision making, especially in the healthcare domain. 


Before joining MIT, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at a [Enolink](https://www.enolink.com/#top-hero), a Healthcare AI start-up based out of Cambridge, MA. There, I had the amazing opportunity to work with a great group of people on designing and deploying clinical decision support systems. Prior to that, I was a software engineer, machine learning at Capital One working on applied NLP projects, building intelligent search and recommendation systems. I received a B.A. in Mathematics from Cornell in the Spring of 2020, concentrating in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

<!-- At Capital One, my work was been focused on building out intelligent search applications aimed to simplify the dense and chaotic network of regulatory documents.  -->
 
As a developer, I use Python as my primary general-purpose language for backend development, data engineering, and data science. My tech stack roughly breaks down as
* Languages: __Python__, Go, SQL
  * Older experience with Java, OCaml
* Deployment + CI/CD: AWS (SA certified), K8s, Docker, Ansible, Gitlab
* Data Engineering: Airflow, Dask
* App Dev: Flask, Django, Vue
* Machine Learning: Python
  * PyTorch for deep learning, scikit-learn for general purpose stuff
  * A large variety of tools for specific applications (spaCy, gensim, XGBoost, lifelines, etc.)

 <!-- but I also have professional experience with Go, SQL and _a little_ Javascript. In the past, I've worked on some projects with Java and OCaml. For deployment and CI/CD, I've used AWS, K8s, Docker, and Ansible. I've used Airflow, Dask, 

As a developer, my tech stack includes Python, Go, AWS, K8s, Docker, SQL, Airflow, Dask, Django, Flask and Vue. I do most of my machine learning work in Python with the usual suspects, and mainly use PyTorch for deep learning projects. -->

<!-- Outside of work, I remain interested in certain research topics, including algorithmic game theory and the intersection of learning theory and game theory. Particularly, I enjoy thinking about the contexts within which learning systems are placed and the interactions both between people and learning systems as well as interactions between learning systems.  -->

I recently added a blog posts discussing my experiences in industry with various techniques for intelligent search. I also added a post covering a side-project I put together for fun over the past week or so, aimed to demonstrate how easy it is to create an intelligent-search application using a pre-trained sentence-BERT model. 


I am now AWS certified!

On April 11, 2021, I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam! This was a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge of AWS services and learn how to efficiently build highly available and scalable applications.
