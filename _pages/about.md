Hello! I'm a grad student at MIT in the <a href="https://orc.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Operations Research Center</a> (ORC) where I am extremely fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://dbertsim.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Dimitris Bertsimas</a>. I'm currently focused on building interpretable, incentive-aware and robust machine learning systems for high-stakes decision making, especially in the healthcare domain. 


Before joining MIT, I was a Machine Learning Engineer at a <a href="https://www.enolink.com/#top-hero" target="_blank">Enolink</a>, a Healthcare AI start-up based out of Cambridge, MA. There, I had the amazing opportunity to work with a great group of people on designing and deploying clinical decision support systems. Prior to that, I was a software engineer, machine learning at Capital One working on applied NLP projects, building intelligent search and recommendation systems. I received a B.A. in Mathematics from Cornell in the Spring of 2020, concentrating in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

 
As a developer, I use Python as my primary general-purpose language for backend development, data engineering, and machine learning. My tech stack includes Python, Go, SQL, AWS (SA Certified), K8s, Docker, Ansible, Gitlab, Flask/Django, and Vue. For data engineering, I've worked with Airflow and Dask. For data engineering, I've worked with Airflow and Dask. For ML/DS work, I've used (and developed) many libraries in Python, using primarily PyTorch for deep learning projects, along with a host of other libraries for specific applications such as NLP, Survival Analysis, Explainable + Interpretable ML, tabluar data, and more.

I recently added a blog posts discussing my experiences in industry with various techniques for intelligent search. I also added a post covering a side-project I put together for fun over the past week or so, aimed to demonstrate how easy it is to create an intelligent-search application using a pre-trained sentence-BERT model. 


I am now AWS certified!

On April 11, 2021, I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam! This was a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge of AWS services and learn how to efficiently build highly available and scalable applications.
