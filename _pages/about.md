Hello! I am a software engineer at Capital One, based out of Cambridge, MA. Prior to joining Capital One, I received a B.A. in Mathematics from Cornell, concentrating in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

My recent work has been focused on building out intelligent search applications aimed to simplify the dense and chaotic network of regulatory documents. 

Currently, my primary tech stack includes Python, Go, SQL, AWS (including Lambdas), Airflow, Django and Vue. I do most of my machine learning work in Python with the usual suspects, such as Pytorch, Scikit-learn, Gensim, and Hugging Face.

Outside of work, I remain interested in certain research topics, including algorithmic game theory and the intersection of learning theory and game theory. Particularly, I enjoy thinking about the contexts within which learning systems are placed and the interactions both between people and learning systems as well as interactions between learning systems.

I recently added a blog posts discussing my experiences in industry with various techniques for intelligent search. I also added a post covering a side-project I put together for fun over the past week or so, aimed to demonstrate how easy it is to create an intelligent-search application using a pre-trained sentence-BERT model. 


I am now AWS certified!

On April 11, 2021, I passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam! This was a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge of AWS services and learn how to efficiently build highly available and scalable applications.
