Education
======
* B.A. in Mathematics with Honors, Cornell University, 2020
  * Concentration in Applied Math, Minor in Computer Science

Work experience
======
* __Software Engineer, Machine Learning -  Capital One, Cambridge, MA (August 2020 - Present)__
  * Developing a suite of semantic recommendation systems with underlying NLP models to simplify and improve the experience of both finding and creating relevant and effective regulatory documents for our risk associates. 
  * Owned end-to-end development of a new intelligent search feature. Designed implementation plan, conducted experiments, documented and presented results, integrated final model selection into backend, and updated the ETL pipeline and UI.
  * Pitched and created an intelligent writing assistant tool for our domain based on a custom BERT classification model and spaCy language model for a company Hackathon. Project won 2nd place and development is being continued. 
  * Creating a Q&A information retrieval system for policy documents based on a sentence-BERT model to improve the experience of answering policy-related questions. 
  * Organized and led presentations with diverse internal audiences, covering topics such as word embedding models and deploying NLP services to production. 
  * Tech: Python, Django, Vue.js, Apache Airflow, AWS, SQL, PyTorch, Gensim, Hugging Face, spaCy, Word2Vec, sentence-BERT


* __Software Engineer Intern - Schlumberger, Houston, TX (June 2019 - August 2019)__
  * Developed a python package for predictive monitoring and analysis of processing
facilities containing nonlinear Bayesian filters, online event detection, and forecasting
for time series data.
  * Validated python package using application-specific data and demonstrated increase
in forecasting ability from 30 days to 120 days.
  * Created a full-stack dashboard to analyze online model performance with a backend
written in Go, using Google Cloud Platform for data storage and Grafana for data visualization.
